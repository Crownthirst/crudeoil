# Crude Oil Data Visualization using gganimate in R
## Overview
This repository contains R code and data files for visualizing crude oil data from the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2023 using the gganimate package in R. The gganimate package allows us to create animated visualizations, providing a dynamic and engaging way to observe trends and patterns in the crude oil market over the specified period.

## Data Source
The crude oil data used in this project is sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The data covers the years from 2009 to 2023 and includes daily records of crude oil prices.

## Requirements
To replicate the visualization, you need the following software and R packages installed:

* R 
* ggplot2
* gganimate
* dplyr 
* Other necessary packages as mentioned in the R script

## Animation Details

The animated visualization showcases the daily trends in crude oil prices in USD from 2009 to 2023. Each frame of the animation represents a day, displaying the corresponding prices. The animation evolves over time, allowing you to observe fluctuations, seasonality, and potential long-term trends in the crude oil market.


## Feedback and Contributions
Feedback and contributions are always welcome! If you have any suggestions for improving the visualization or spot any issues with the code or data, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Visualizing! ðŸ“ˆðŸŽ‰
