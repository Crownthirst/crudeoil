# Crude Oil Data Visualization using gganimate in R
## Overview
This repository contains R code and data files for visualizing crude oil data from the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2023 using the gganimate package in R. The gganimate package allows us to create animated visualizations, providing a dynamic and engaging way to observe trends and patterns in the crude oil market over the specified period.

## Data Source
The crude oil data used in this project is sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), a reliable data provider that offers historical crude oil price and production data for Nigeria. The data covers the years from 2009 to 2023 and includes monthly records of crude oil prices and production volumes.

## Requirements
To replicate the visualization, you need the following software and R packages installed:

* R 
* ggplot2
* gganimate
* dplyr 
* Other necessary packages as mentioned in the R script

## Instructions
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required software and packages installed (listed under "Requirements").
Open R or RStudio and set the working directory to the location of the cloned/downloaded repository.
Run the R script visualize_crudeoil_data.R. This script contains all the code needed to preprocess the data and generate the animated visualization.
The script will fetch the crude oil data from the Central Bank of Nigeria and create a series of static ggplot charts for each month. It will then animate them together using gganimate.
Once the script is executed, the animated visualization will be saved in the specified output format (e.g., GIF or MP4) in the same working directory.
Animation Details
The animated visualization showcases the monthly trends in crude oil prices and production volumes in Nigeria from 2009 to 2023. Each frame of the animation represents a single month, displaying the corresponding price and production values. The animation evolves over time, allowing you to observe fluctuations, seasonality, and potential long-term trends in the Nigerian crude oil market.


## Feedback and Contributions
Feedback and contributions are always welcome! If you have any suggestions for improving the visualization or spot any issues with the code or data, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Visualizing! ðŸ“ˆðŸŽ‰
